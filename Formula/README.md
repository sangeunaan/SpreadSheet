# Comments to Formula:

The goal of this project is refactoring the formula evaluator from Assignment 1.
This class library provide the programs to handle various exceptions about the inappropriate expressions, which is well known as the syntax error.
The newly added function in this project is to determine and assign the value of a variable using delegates.


# Assignment Specific Topics:

It was confusing to load the Evaluator function from FormulaEvaluator library to this project, due to the parameters.
Calling the function from the reference library instead of modifying the method was the challenging work.
