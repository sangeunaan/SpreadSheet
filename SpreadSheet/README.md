# Comments to Spreadsheet:

The goal of this project is Refactoring the Spreadsheet from AS4, which implement the cell that contains the name and the contents.
The program also sets and gets the value and the contents by calculating the contents of each cells and their dependencies.
What is new for AS5 is the new class and methods to save the spreadsheet file as XML 
and check whether the file has changed or not. 

# Assignment Specific Topics:

Saving the file as XML was the most complicating task for this assignment.
The usage of the methods for System.XML was helpful to make the new classes to save the file.
And I am still figuring out the way without adding new class to read the file for getting changed version of file.
